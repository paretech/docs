# Constant Current Sink

## Introduction

1. [Using MOSFET Safe Operating Area Curves in Your Design (TI AN)](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sluaao2/sluaao2.pdf)

## Resources

- Constant Current load (analog control loop MOSFET, OpAmp, current sense feedback loop)
- Low-side (simpler) versus high-side current sense
- Constant-current discharge
- Measure battery voltage
- Measure discharge current
- Cut-off voltage
- Temperature sensing
- Discharge profiles
- Reverse polarity protection
- Input fuse

## Notes

- A precision current sink can by created with a transistor, amplifier, and voltage reference.
- Thing of FET as a transconductance device, with gate-sourcve voltage programming the drain current.  
- Transconductance g_m is the ratio of i_d/V_gs.
- The gate of a MOSFET is insulated from the drain source channel
- The drain-source resistance is programmed by the gate-source voltage.
