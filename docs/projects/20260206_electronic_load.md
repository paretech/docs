# Electronic Load (one-pager)

## Purpose

- Make documented hardware design decisions
- Fabricate prototype (i.e., PCBA)
- Have not created a PCBA in long time
- Demonstrate HW system used to test another system

## System Overview

One paragraph description of the system

- Who uses it
- In what environment
- Success definition
- 3–5 measurable outcomes
  - (speed, accuracy, throughput, cost, reliability, etc.)

## Goals

Concrete, testable outcomes.

## Non-Goals

## Concept of Operations (ConOps)

Short real-world narrative:

- User powers system
- Connects DUT
- Runs calibration
- Collects data
- Exports results

Include:

- Environment assumptions
- Human interaction level
- External dependencies

## Requirements

Key Requirements and Constraints

## Key Decisions and Rationale

## Verification Strategy

## Risks and Unknowns

## Roles and Responsibilities
