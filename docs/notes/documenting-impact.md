# Documenting Your Impact

## Purpose

A process for extracting signals about a role, team, and expectations.

Useful for interviews, resume framing, and role evaluation.

## Impact Questions

Shift mindset from "what did you do?" to "why did it matter you were there?".

For each position or project, answer these questions.

These questions are deliberately written in first person singular voice to form self-referential prompts.

Try to respond to these questions in single-line bullet form. Doing so will make indecision less likely and easier to revisit and refine. If you are having trouble, feel free to use a longer narrative form, but realize that may be expensive.

### "What problem space did I own?"

> What was broken, risky, slow, unclear, or impossible before I was involved?

Examples:

- Unreliable test infrastructure
- Manual validation that didn't scale well
- Fragile prototypes

### "What did I personally change or create?"

> What would not exist, or be worse, if I had not been there?

Focus On:

- Systems you designed
- Frameworks you introduced
- Processes you stabilized
- Architectural decisions you made

Avoid:

- Tool lists
- Team-wide accomplishments you merely participated in

### "What technical judgment did I make?"

> What decisions did I make?
>
> What trade-offs did I evaluate?
>
> What constraints did I balance (time, money, quality, performance, technical, organizational)?
>
> Where did I choose not to over-engineer?

### "Who relied on my work?"

> Who would have been blocked if it were not for my efforts?

Examples:

- Manufacturing
- Firmware
- Software
- Test Operators
- Research Scientists
- Customer
- Other teams

### "What changed as a result of my work?"

> What got faster, safer, cheaper, more reliable or even possible?

Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics, sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough.

- "Unblocked X"
- "Reduced iteration time"
- "Enabled parallel development"
- "Improved signal quality"
- "Made system diagnosable"

## Intentional Framing

Framing refers to how you choose and structure your experiences, presenting them to your audience as a controlled and favorable narrative.

Weak Framing:
>Worked on camera calibration scripts and data collection.

Intentional Framing:
>Owned end-to-end camera calibration and data collection pipelines, enabling reliable multi-camera experiments across research platforms.

Intentional framing provides the reader with enough information to infer ownership, scope and impact. From the example, the reader may infer that you are a "systems" thinker.

Framing is not exaggerating or keyword stuffing. Framing is choosing the right way to present the experience to demonstrate your value.

### Characteristics of an intentionally framed experience

- Strong Agency: Who is the actor?
  - Limited: "was involved in"
  - Strong: "Designed, owned, led, implemented"
- Broad Scope: How big was the system or problem?
  - Narrow: "Updated a script"
  - Broad: "Built automations used across four product lines"
- Explicit Intent: Why did this work exist?
  - Implicit: "Created dashboards"
  - Explicit: "Created dashboards to surface reliability regressions early"
- Measurable Impact: What changed because of your work efforts?
  - Missing: "...using Python"
  - Measurable: "...reduced setup time by 40% and improved throughput" (quantifiable or directional)
