# COG Engineer 101

## Foreword

Around 2016, a mentor of mine gave me a photocopied document titled "COG Engineer 101". This document appears to have been "drafted" in 1990 by an unnamed engineer from the [Federal System Division of IBM at its development and manufacturing facility in Owego, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Systems_Integration_%E2%80%93_Owego).

The document is handwritten by someone with drafting experience. The letters are perfectly blocked, evenly spaced. The top corner of each page has a date and timestamp. There are hand drawn block diagrams, with the same perfect draftmanship. The document is beautiful, a work of art, and reads like a proposal for a larger effort.

I struggled with what to do with this document. Every so often, I would dig it out and read it. It was simple and I thought it firm foundation in a larger topic. A good refresher, a north star. After a move, I thought I had lost it. I searched for it eery time I cleaned a room, got ready to purge old stuff, cleaned the garage. I finally found it, and realized I needed to do something with it. Capture it for myself and for others. By publishing this, it is not my intent to take credit for or ownership of it. My intentions of publishing it is for preservation.

I have taken liberties to exapand acronyms and occasionally sprinkle in links to resources I found when investigating acronyms and program names. When program names and acronyms were used, care was taken to ensure these appear in public space prior to making this version of the document  available. To the best of my knowledge, there is no sensitive information in these words.

The remainder of this document is very close to the original photocopied version. I hope you enjoy.

## Proposal to Develop a Subsystem Engineering Guide

Historically, major engineering categories have become recognized as definite disciplines. These disciplines have progressively defined and refined their operating procedures in order to become more professional, thereby becoming more efficient, improving communication with peers and related disiplines, standardizing key attributes of their disipine, etc.

Software engineering is a dramatic example of this process. System engineering has taken significant steps in this direction in the past decade. It is now time to extend the process to subsystem engineering.

Because of the activity in this area during the [Light Airborn Multipurpose System (LAMPS)](https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1980/pdf/jun80.pdf), [HH-60](https://www.nhahistoricalsociety.org/sh-60f-sikorsky-s-70b-seahawk-helicopter/), CTII, ASOA, etc programs, extensive experience exists in IBM involving subsystem engineering. However, this experience tends to be contained within people and does not exist as a documented body of knowledge. As a consequence, inexperienced (in subystem engineering) personnel assigned to this activity have no ready reasource, but must ferret out his assignment requirements from a variety of sources. Besides being inefficient, intimidating, and sometimes humiliating, it can result in significant program peerformance problems since there is no gurantee that he will discover all his required activities in a timely manner. It is the purpose of this proposal to take a significant step in developing this documented body of knowledge.
