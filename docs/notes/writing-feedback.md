## Latin Abbreviations

### e.g. and i.e

Both abbreviations are conventionally followed by a comma in American English.

| Abbreviation | Latin | Meaning | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| **e.g.** | *exempli gratia* | "for example" | Prefer open transitions (e.g., open stairwell) |
| **i.e.** | *id est* | "that is" | Use the primary entrance (i.e., the front door) |

**Tip**: Treat them like their English equivalents—"for example," and "that is,"—comma included.

**Note**: British English often omits the comma. Both styles are understood, but the comma version is considered more formally correct in American usage.

## Comma Splices

### What is a Comma Splice?

A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined only by a comma.

An **independent clause** is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. It has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete idea.

### Example of a Comma Splice

> Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics, sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough.

This is incorrect because both parts are independent clauses:

1. "Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics" — complete thought
2. "sometimes 'directional' outcomes are enough" — complete thought

### How to Fix a Comma Splice

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Period** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics. Sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Semicolon** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics; sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Conjunction** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics, because sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Em dash** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics—sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |

### When to Use Each Method

- **Period**: Creates the strongest separation. Use when the ideas are related but distinct.
- **Semicolon**: Preserves a close relationship between ideas while keeping them in one sentence. Use when the second clause directly follows from or contrasts with the first.
- **Conjunction**: Adds explicit logical connection (because, and, but, so). Use when you want to clarify the relationship.
- **Em dash**: Adds emphasis or a dramatic pause. Use sparingly for stylistic effect.

## Commonly Misspelled Words

- compatibility
<!-- cspell:ignore compatability ibility -->
- Not: compatability
- Tip: Comes from "compatible" → drop the 'e', add "-ibility" (not "-ability")

## Verb Tense: choose vs. chose vs. chosen

English irregular verbs don't follow the regular "-ed" pattern for past tense. **Choose** is a common source of errors because the spelling change is subtle.

| Tense | Form | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Present** | choose | I choose a color every morning. |
| **Past** | chose | I chose blue yesterday. |
| **Past participle** | chosen | I have chosen blue three days in a row. |

**Why it matters**: Using "choose" when describing a past event makes the sentence read as present tense, which confuses the timeline of your narrative.

**Spotted in**: "I choose a friction wedge retention mechanism" — should be "I **chose** a friction wedge retention mechanism" because the decision was already made.

## Compound Adjective Hyphenation

When two or more words work together as a single modifier **before a noun**, they should be hyphenated. This prevents ambiguity about which words modify what.

| Position | Hyphenate? | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Before the noun** | Yes | A well-behaved model |
| **After the noun** | No | The model is well behaved |

**Common examples**: well-known author, high-quality material, self-locking mechanism, fully-constrained model.

**Exception**: Adverbs ending in "-ly" are never hyphenated (e.g., "a fully constrained model" is correct without a hyphen because "fully" is an -ly adverb — the reader already knows it modifies the next word).

**Spotted in**: "well behaved" before "model" — should be "well-behaved model." However, "fully constrained" was actually correct as-is because of the -ly exception.

## Common Idioms

### give (someone) pause

- **Meaning**: To cause hesitation or reconsideration
- **Example**: "The unexpected cost gave me pause before signing the contract."
