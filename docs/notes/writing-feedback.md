## Comma Splices

### What is a Comma Splice?

A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined only by a comma.

An **independent clause** is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. It has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete idea.

### Example of a Comma Splice

> Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics, sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough.

This is incorrect because both parts are independent clauses:

1. "Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics" — complete thought
2. "sometimes 'directional' outcomes are enough" — complete thought

### How to Fix a Comma Splice

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Period** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics. Sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Semicolon** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics; sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Conjunction** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics, because sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |
| **Em dash** | Do not chase perfect quantifiable metrics—sometimes "directional" outcomes are enough. |

### When to Use Each Method

- **Period**: Creates the strongest separation. Use when the ideas are related but distinct.
- **Semicolon**: Preserves a close relationship between ideas while keeping them in one sentence. Use when the second clause directly follows from or contrasts with the first.
- **Conjunction**: Adds explicit logical connection (because, and, but, so). Use when you want to clarify the relationship.
- **Em dash**: Adds emphasis or a dramatic pause. Use sparingly for stylistic effect.

## Commonly Misspelled Words

- compatibility
  - Not: compatability
  - Tip: Comes from "compatible" → drop the 'e', add "-ibility" (not "-ability")

## Common Idioms

### give (someone) pause

- **Meaning**: To cause hesitation or reconsideration
- **Example**: "The unexpected cost gave me pause before signing the contract."
