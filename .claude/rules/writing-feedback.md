# Writing Feedback Rules

## When reviewing documents for spelling, grammar, and clarity

- Always explain the "why" behind suggested corrections
- Provide brief educational context so the user can learn the underlying rule
- For grammar issues, name the concept (e.g., "comma splice", "dangling modifier") and explain what it means
- Include examples of correct usage when helpful
- Keep explanations concise but informative
- After explaining a grammar or writing concept, ask if the user would like to add it to docs/notes/writing-feedback.md for future reference

## Markdown Linting Context

This project has three levels of markdownlint enforcement (VS Code, pre-commit, CI). When editing markdown files, IDE diagnostics may appear automatically from the VS Code linter—these are not user-flagged issues. See `docs/notes/site-setup.md` for the full linting configuration.
