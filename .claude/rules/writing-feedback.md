# Writing Feedback Rules

When reviewing documents for spelling, grammar, and clarity:

- Always explain the "why" behind suggested corrections
- Provide brief educational context so the user can learn the underlying rule
- For grammar issues, name the concept (e.g., "comma splice", "dangling modifier") and explain what it means
- Include examples of correct usage when helpful
- Keep explanations concise but informative
- After explaining a grammar or writing concept, ask if the user would like to add it to docs/notes/writing-feedback.md for future reference
