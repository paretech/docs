# Site Setup Rules

When making changes to site configuration, build process, dependencies, or development workflow:

- Recommend updating docs/notes/site-setup.md to reflect the changes
- This includes changes to: mkdocs.yml, pyproject.toml, Makefile, .pre-commit-config.yaml, GitHub workflows, VS Code settings, or any new tooling
- The goal is to keep site-setup.md as the single source of truth for how the site works
